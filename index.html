**Resources for SPLA**

**Linear algebra**: *Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra* (chapters 1-7)

PDF available at: https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/vmls.pdf

**Finite fields**: *Elements of Abstract Algebra* (part 3, pg. 67-75)

PDF available at: http://poincare.matf.bg.ac.rs/~zarkom/Book_Math_Clark_Elements_of_abstract_algebra%202.pdf

(It is also a very small book from Dover that I use a lot; hereâ€™s one purchase place: https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Abstract-Algebra-Dover-Mathematics/dp/0486647250 but I'm sure there are a million other places to buy used!)

**Error correcting codes**: *CS250 Lecture Notes*

Lecture 1 PDF: https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs250/lectureNotes/Lecture1-compressed.pdf

Lecture 2 PDF: https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs250/lectureNotes/Lecture2-compressed.pdf

Lecture 4 PDF: https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs250/lectureNotes/Lecture4-compressed.pdf

**Copying messages below here so the pinned message is a self-contained reference!**

*For linear algebra:* skim chap. 1-7, taking care to focus on the parts that "feel" more difficult (it's a very casual exposition, so this should, hopefully(!), not be too painful)

*For finite fields:* the readings there and a few exercises might be really useful; up to you. The only thing you'll really have to know is that we can add, subtract, multiply, or divide numbers in finite fields

The error correcting codes are *very* optional, but the notes have good review, especially if you're already familiar with both finite fields and linear algebra (see [messages below this one](https://discord.com/channels/740913612368904192/1175768922197331978/1176947271716323328) for a guide!)
